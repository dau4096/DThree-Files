Look! A Pilot! Now the odds are in our favour.
THEY'RE TRYING TO CORNER US!
They're trying to pin us down, we need to move!
ALL FOR THE 6-4!
Trust me.
Congratulations on your field promotion, pilot.
I will not lose another pilot.
Deploying ticks!
He seems to have some sort of... advanced cloaking package!?
I think our Militia pilot's trying to be a hero.
Who said anything about salvage?¬I'll do this one for free.
Just get my money ready.¬You'll have your precious cargo, you useless naff.
Your journey ends here, Pilot.¬The skies belong to me.¬Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.
Care to have a real fight? Let's see what you got up close and personal.¬Oder willst du weglaufen wie ein kleiner Junge?
Objection; Cooper *is* my pilot.
Power low. Insufficent power.
Noted.
Pilot, I need assistance!
My name is BT-7274, but you may call me BT.
As far as I'm concerned, you've earned that pilot certification, cooper.
When you get to hell, tell them Viper sent you.
Vipers got you in the pipes, five by five.
