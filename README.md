## Formatting Rules;
- A new command must be in its own file in the phrases directory, with the filename in all lower-case.
- This lowercase name must also be added to cmds.txt.
- Every line in the command text file is its own response to be randomly picked.
- Use of the `Â¬` character allows for newlines in the discord reply.
- Uses default discord formatting.
